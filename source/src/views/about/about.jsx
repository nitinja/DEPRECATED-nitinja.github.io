        I am multiâ€‘disciplinary designer and frontend developer. I have led
        small frontend and design teams in recent past. I have been working in
        the industry for around 10 years, for startups as well as industry
        leaders in multiple domains. I have done UX design and development for
        companies including HP, Persistent systems.

        While I was still in college, I started building products as freelance
        programmer and graphic designer, and then slowly migrated to
        professional design/development. I have also worked on Information
        architecture, user journeys and interaction design.

        I greatly appreciate and follow design & UX principles. I believe that
        polished UI is just one part of the great experience - product should
        work great as well. I also strive for great DX (Developer experience).
        Functional programming principles, design patterns and linting is part
        of my development process.
